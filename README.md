# LampreyDB

As one of the two most ancient groups of extant vertebrates, lamprey has become an important model organism in various fields of biology. In this paper, we present a comprehensive tissue-wide spatial metabolomics dataset for lampreys, where 14 distinct tissues were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in both positive and negative ion modes. The dataset has been fully validated using internal standard and pooled quality control samples, and is readily accessible at the UCSD Metabolomics Workbench. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers using lampreys as a model organism. Additionally, it acts as a benchmark metabolomics dataset for evaluating new algorithms and software tools, and comparing them with previously published results. A lamprey spatial metabolomics database (https://www.lampreydb.com) is also provided to support studies utilizing lampreys as an animal model, and to complement and validate other spatial metabolomics studies on lampreys conducted with mass spectrometry imaging or other techniques.
